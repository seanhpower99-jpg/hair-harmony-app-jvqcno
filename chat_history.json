There should be two versions of the app, similar to Uber, where you have a customer facing side and provider facing side. Revenue is generated by monthly plans for the hairdressers, basic, premium and gold, which will also boost their visibility. There should be profiles for both the customers and the hairdressers, with ratings, again similar to Uber. The profiles should also integrate with socials to showcase the hairdressers styles. I was thinking it should be called Trimz or Cutz. Payment should be taken via PayPal and Apple Pay. The app should also have a map feature to see what barbers are nearby, and also sections for popular barbers, barbers available today and favourites."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand you're envisioning a \"Trimz\" or \"Cutz\" app, connecting hairdressers and customers, similar to Uber, with revenue from hairdresser subscription plans.
